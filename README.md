# ML from Scratch ðŸš€

**Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio!**  
I'm JosÃ© Manuel HernÃ¡ndez de Labra, a Biomedical Engineer with a deep passion for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics, especially in Structural Bioinformatics. This repository is a collection of projects where I build ML algorithms from the ground up, delving into the mathematics that powers them, and applying these algorithms to real-world datasets or problems that intrigue me.

## Repository Overview
This repository is divided into three main sections:

1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning
3. Bioinformatics  

Each section contains a collection of projects, and within each project, you'll find:

A detailed `README`: Outlines the project goals, methodology, and key takeaways.  
`Jupyter Notebooks`: Break down the mathematical concepts and walk through the algorithm development step by step.  
Source Code: Implemented from scratch using Python (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch) or C.  

I continuously update this repository with new projects, so feel free to star it and stay tuned for more!


## Projects
### 1. Machine Learning

- **[Multiple Linear Regression](Machine%20Learning/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression/)**  
Multiple linear regression from scratch to predict gene expression levels based on various genomic features
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
Implementation of the KNN algorithm with a focus on understanding the distance metrics and how they impact model performance.

### 2. Deep Learning
- **[Simple Neural Network](Deep%20Learning/Neural%20Network/)**  
Building a neural network from scratch using Tensorflow and training it to approximate te Sine function. The project covers forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization techniques.


### 3. Bioinformatics
Protein Structure Prediction
Explore how machine learning models can be applied to predict protein structures based on amino acid sequences.

RNA Binding Site Prediction
A project focused on predicting RNA binding sites using various machine learning techniques.

## Visualization & Mastery Showcase
To make the content more engaging and to demonstrate my expertise, I've created a series of animations and GIFs:

Gradient Descent Visualization: A GIF showing the optimization process of gradient descent over different loss landscapes.

Neural Network Training: An animation of a neural network learning from data, with weight adjustments visualized in real-time.

Decision Boundaries: A dynamic visualization of how different machine learning algorithms like KNN, SVM, and Logistic Regression create decision boundaries as data is introduced.

Protein Folding Simulation: A 3D animation showing how a protein folds into its functional form, highlighting the role of bioinformatics.
Here is a list of the projects:
