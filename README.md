# Welcome :)
Im a Biomedical Engineer with a passion for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics (especifically Structural Bioinformatics).
This is my portfolio where I will be implementing ML algorithms from scratch, understanding the math behind them and applying them to interesting problems for me. I will also be implementing some of the algorithms in Python and maybe C. I will be updating this repository regularly. Stay tuned!

## Projects
I divided the projects in folders, each folder contains a `README.md` file with a brief explanation of the project and the code, and a `Jupyter Notebook` with the explanation of the math behind the algorithm.

Here is a list of the projects:
- [Linear Regression](Linear%20Regression/)
- [Simple Neural Network](Neural%20Network/)
