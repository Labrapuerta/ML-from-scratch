# Welcome :)
Im a Biomedical Engineer with a passion for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics (especifically Structural Bioinformatics).
This is my portfolio where I will be implementing ML algorithms from scratch, understanding the math behind them and applying them to interesting problems for me. I will also be implementing some of the algorithms in Python and maybe C. I will be updating this repository regularly. Stay tuned!

## Projects
- [Linear Regression]()
- [Simple Neural Network](Neural%20Network/)
