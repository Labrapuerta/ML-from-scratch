# Predicting RNA Secondary Structures Using Transformer Model :robot:

## Overview
This project involves implementing the Transformer architecture from scratch using tensors and automatic differentiation in Tensorflow and applying it to predict RNA secondary structures from nucleotide sequences. Accurately predicting RNA secondary structures is crucial for understanding RNA functionality, interactions, and roles in various biological processes.
