## Overview

## Mathemathics behind Linear Regression
I created a `Jupyter Notebook` to explain the mathemathics behind the linear regression. You can find the notebook [here](MLR_explanation.ipynb). It's easy to understand and I hope it will help you to understand the mathemathics behind the linear regression.
